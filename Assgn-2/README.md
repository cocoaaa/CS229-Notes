##Notes and thoughts on Assignment-2.
* For SVMs read Notes. 
* Solutions for Problem 1 are ![here](https://github.com/sudk1896/CS229-Notes/blob/master/Assgn-2/CodeCogsEqn.png).
* Most of them boil down to deriving the form ![here](https://github.com/sudk1896/CS229-Notes/blob/master/Assgn-2/PSD.png), you express it as a square of sums, which will always be greater than equal to zero.
* Matlab code for Naive Bayes with Multinomial Event model is ![here](https://github.com/sudk1896/CS229-Notes/blob/master/Assgn-2/nb_train.m), pretty straightforward. The results after training on datasets of sizes (no. of documents) 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1400, 2144 are, in percentages, 3.87,2.62, 2.62, 1.87, 1.75, 1.63, 1.63. Its the exact same answer as given in the key. The test data is weak, if you know what I mean!.
