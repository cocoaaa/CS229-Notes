##Notes and thoughts on Generalized Linear Models.
* Read Andrew Ng's notes for full explanation
* In Logistic Regreassion, the separation line is same for both, labels {0, 1} and {-1, 1}. Only the regression formula
is tweaked a little bit - Read [here](www.hongliangjie.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/logistic.pdf) for in-depth explanation.
* For Pset-1 problem on Logistic regression via Newton's Method, somehow initializing theta with all 1s only seems to work.
