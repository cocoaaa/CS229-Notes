##Notes and thoughts on Generalized Linear Models.
* Read Andrew Ng's notes for full explanation
* In Logistic Regreassion, the separation line is same for both, labels {0, 1} and {-1, 1}. Only the regression formula
is tweaked a little bit - Read [here](www.hongliangjie.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/logistic.pdf) for in-depth explanation.
* For Pset-1 problem on Logistic regression via Newton's Method, somehow initializing theta with all 1s only seems to work.
* For notes on Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Logistic Regression, an in-depth explanation is - [here](http://sites.stat.psu.edu/~jiali/course/stat597e/notes2/logit.pdf).
* Trick for solving Problem 3 on Gaussian Discrimant Analysis, think in terms of Indicator Random Variables. The labels here are {1, -1}. In this case formula is [this](https://github.com/sudk1896/CS229-Notes/blob/master/Assgn-1/CodeCogsEqn.gif).
